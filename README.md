This is an animated bunny.  I extracted it from a GIF that I saw posted on
twitter, and failed to find the origins of via the internet.

There are two versions here:

 * bunny.py is a python script that runs in a terminal
 * bunny.html is html/js for the browser

See the html version at http://mcpherrin.ca/bunny/bunny.html
