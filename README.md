This is an animated bunny.  I extracted it from a GIF that I saw posted on
twitter, and failed to find the origins of via the internet.

 * bunny.py is a python script that runs in a terminal
 * bunny.html is html/js for the browser

See the html version at https://mcpherrinm.github.io/bunny/

Run `convert -coalesce bunny.gif frame_%03d.gif && python extract.py` to
rebuild the bunny.py script.
